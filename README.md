**Project Overview:**
This project leverages machine learning to optimize hospital revenue through data-driven insights and predictive modeling. It begins with data wrangling, cleaning, and exploratory analysis to identify statistical relationships between key factors influencing revenue in a synthetic medical group.

**Methodology and Approach:**
The project focuses on Decision Tree and Linear Regression models, primarily using Scikit-learn and other Python ML libraries. Through feature selection, model tuning, and cross-validation, I developed predictive models capable of forecasting revenue with a 10% accuracy margin.

**Key steps include:**
* Data Wrangling & Cleaning: Addressed inconsistencies, outliers, and missing values to ensure reliable input for modeling.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed correlations, distributions, and trends within the data.
* Model Development: Fine-tuned Decision Tree for categorical insights and Linear Regression for continuous revenue forecasting.
* Model Validation: Used performance metrics (R-squared, RMSE) to assess and refine model accuracy.

**Future Directions:**
* **Refine Regression Model:** Further feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning to improve prediction accuracy.
* **Explore Advanced Models:** Investigate Random Forest and XGBoost for a more robust predictive system.
* **Data Standardization:** Recommend standardizing data collection methods across healthcare locations to improve consistency and model reliability.
* **Web Application:** Propose a web-based platform for real-time data integration, enhancing model performance.
